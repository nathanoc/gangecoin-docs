            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>GangeCoin is a virtual currency which runs entirely on Microsoft Power Automate. Transactions work using commands sent via email. <em>For an email to be registered as a command, it must have the subject line "GNG".</em></p>

            <h2>Commands</h2>

            <p><em>Note that all commands must have the subject line "GNG".</em></p>

            <h3>Balance</h3>
            <p>Syntax: <span class="syntax">balance</span></p>
            <p>Shows your current balance in GangeCoin.</p>

            <h3>Cooldown</h3>
            <p>Syntax: <span class="syntax">cooldown [mine, steal]</span></p>
            <p>Shows the length of the cooldown relevant to the argument given.</p>

            <h3>Create</h3>
            <p>Syntax: <span class="syntax">create</span></p>
            <p>Creates an account if you do not have one already.</p>

            <h3>Give</h3>
            <p>Syntax: <span class="syntax">give [target email] [amount]</span></p>
            <p>Sends a given amount of GangeCoin to an address, provided they have an account. The payee will receive an email informing them of the transaction.</p>
            <p>If the value paid is negative, a robbery will be attempted. This has a chance of success inversely proportional to the amount attempted to steal, with a minimum probability of 0.1% and a maximum of 50%. If successful, any amount of GangeCoin can be stolen, even if this leaves the victim with a negative balance. If unsuccessful, the thief's balance will be reset to zero, and all their subsequent robbery attempts for a period afterward will also fail.</p>
            <p><em>The target email is case-sensitive.</em></p>

            <h3>Mine</h3>
